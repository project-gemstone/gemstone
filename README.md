# Project Gemstone
The journey starts here.

## What is it?
Project Gemstone is a project to create the next Linux operating system focusing on server, container, and distributed workloads. The project takes a few ideas / features from lots of Linux distributions out there in the wild and reuses them for server applications. Below is a few examples:

* Small footprint - `Alpine Linux`
* Modules (Group packages) and delta binaries - `Intel Clear Linux`
* A / B Backups - `Container Linux / CoreOS`
* BUILDPKG packaging format - `Archlinux`
* From scratch base - `Linux From Scratch / Void Linux / Venom Linux`
